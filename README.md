# NFT-Collection

Scenario: Now its time to launch your own NFT collection - `Crypto Devs`.

## Requirements

- There should only exist 20 Crypto Dev NFT's and each one of them should be unique.
- User's should be able to mint only 1 NFT with one transaction.
- Whitelisted users, should have a 5 min presale period before the actual sale where they are guaranteed 1 NFT per transaction.
- There should be a website for your NFT Collection.

## Prerequisites

- Already completed the [Whitelist dApp tutorial](https://github.com/AzureKn1ght/Whitelist-Dapp)

## Theory

- What is a Non-Fungible Token?
  Fungible means to be the same or interchangeable (eg. ETH is fungible). With this in mind, NFTs are unique; each one is different. Every single token has unique characteristics and values. They are all distinguishable from one another and are not interchangeable (eg. Unique Art).

- What is ERC-721?
  ERC-721 is an open standard that describes how to build Non-Fungible tokens on EVM (Ethereum Virtual Machine) compatible blockchains; it is a standard interface for Non-Fungible tokens; it has a set of rules which make it easy to work with NFTs. Before moving ahead have a look at all the functions supported by [ERC721](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/3.x/api/token/erc721)
